## Logistic Regression :

The Logistic Regression Algorithm deals in discrete values whereas the Linear Regression Algorithm handles predictions in continuous values. This means that Logistic Regression is a better option for binary classification. An event in Logistic Regression is classified as 1 if it occurs and it is classified as 0 otherwise. 

Logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a target variable. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes.
